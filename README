Django Machine Learning Website

Objectives of the web site:
    ML algorithms deployment automation,
    continuous-integration,
    reproducibility of algorithms and predictions,
    diagnostic and monitoring of algorithms in production,
    scalability,
    users collaboration.

Current deployment capabilities:
    can handle many API endpoints,
    each API endpoint can have several ML algorithms with different versions,
    ML code and artifacts (files with ML parameters) are stored in the code repository (git),
    supports fast deployments and continuous integration (tests for both: server and ML code),
    supports monitoring and algorithm diagnostic (support A/B tests),
    is scalable (deployed with containers),
    has a user interface.


How to get the endpoints
The endpoint_name is defining the endpoint that we are trying to reach. To view the endpoints that are available go to
app/v1/endpoints. Locate the 'name' line and the value is the endpoint name.

Ex:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/income_classifier/predict

You can specifiy alg status or version in URL.
Ex:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/income_classifier/predict?status=testing&version=1.1.1



The ABTest keeps information about:

    which ML algorithms are tested,
    who and when created the test,
    when test is stopped,
    the test results in the summary field.


The StopABTestView stops the A/B test and compute the accuracy (ratio of correct responses) for each algorithm. The algorithm with higher accurcy is set as production algorithm, the other algorithm is saved with testing status.

Error in http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/mlalgorithmstatuses unable to POST.



Run tests

# please run in backend/server directory
